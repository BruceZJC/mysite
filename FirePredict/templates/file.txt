A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire in rural and urban areas, and it would cause massive damage to the natural vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human properties. In todayâ€™s world, damage to modern societies is much more significant than decades ago. Taking the California wildfire in 2020 as an example, 4.2 million acres of fields, damaging or destroying 10500 structures and killed 31 people[1]. State authorities ordered 70,000 Sonoma and Napa County residents to evacuate[1], which leads to a high probability of being exposed to the coronavirus during the current pandemic. A model that predicts the occurrence of wildfire could shorten the response time for both residents and the fire department near the hotspot of wildfire. Eventually, a wildfire prediction model could save lives and properties due to wildfire damage. To create a machine learning model to predict wildfire, we could use the existing data to identify major hotspots for wildfire as well as the common periods. In addition, we need to develop a web UI to interact with the machine learning model to predict the possibility of wildfire.
